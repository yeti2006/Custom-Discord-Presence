Create your own custom discord rich presence. This is my first project :p but I'm not dissapointed atleast


Hello :D

This program would allow you to create your own custom rich presence in discord.

Here's an example:

# Custom Discord RPC

<center><h2> What's new? <h2></center>

____

* Added Minimize to System Tray functionality.
* Added Reload Button. 
* Added data console thingy. (Shows what you've entered...)

**So how do I use this?**

You have to extract the zip and store the folder in the zip somewhere. You can either directly run it from the folder, or, create a shortcut and use it.

>How to create an application?

* Go to [this link](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application.
* Name that application the name of your presence. (eg: Call of Duty mobile as in above example)
* Go to the Rich Presence section in the left pane.
* You will be on the Assets tab and from there you can add as much as you want... But make sure you note your image key-names. You will be needing them.

> How to setup the presence?

* Enter your application's ID. That is, the CLIENT ID that's situated right below your application name.

* If, you have images uploaded, enter their key names respectively.

* The client ID, State and Details are required.

* Timestamps are optional. You can get these by visiting [here](https://www.epochconverter.com)

* If you decide to leave the optional ones, just leave them blank. Timestamps would create 'None' inside the box when you open the app next time, either leave it like that or erase it doesn't make a difference.

> How do I disable the presence?
* THE RED STOP BUTTON UR WELCOME. (It takes a little time to clear the presence, like 5 seconds)

> How do I save my presence information so I don't have to retype it again?
* Hit save. Also, when you enter your information and hit start presence, it'll automatically save it too. The save button is an alternative.

> How do I create multiple saves?
* You can create them by going inside the templates folder in the installation directory. Name it whatever you want but make sure you save the file in json format. There is a  _custom_1.json_ for your reference.

* Once you click save, with your template selected from the drop down, it'll save to that template.

* Also, the application would start in the 'Main' template selected the next time you open it.

> How do I something I did is wrong?
* Simple. The program would crash :joy:
* Sorry, I'll handle errors soon.
